===================================

Anki Card Deck containing all words from the book 'Practical Rhythmic Chinese' by [Yin](http://www.uvm.edu/~chinese/?Page=faculty.php) and Sun from the University of Vermont


I have put this on Github for the sharing and collaborative improving, tracking, and fixing of typos.

The file is a tab separated text file. Feel free to fork and edit it according to the style guide:
- Every line of the file corresponds to a flash card
- The format of each card/line is: *text on front* TAB *text on back*
- The cards allow for basic html commands

I recommend importing the *.txt* into the [desktop version of Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) and then using the synchronization server by Anki to transfer it to mobile devices. 

See also the [documentation](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html) of Anki.

Feel free to raise any issues and pull requests.
